** DONE Sort out a basic view of the data

   A table seems like it would work for a first pass.
** TODO Allow users to select sessions to create a personal schedule
** TODO Create "personal schedule" view
** TODO Button to reload schedule
** TODO Remove "workshops" from tabs
** TODO Use days of week rather than day numbers for tabs
** TODO Footer with basic nav and SN details.
* Local storage
** TODO Create a local storage port
   This seems like the most straightforward solution until such time as there's
   a more "official" solution from the elm world.
* Things to think about
** How to respond when the schedule changes
** How often to refresh the view
** Some sort of alert system when selected sessions are about to start?
