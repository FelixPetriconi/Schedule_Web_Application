   A table seems like it would work for a first pass.
** DONE Allow users to select sessions to create a personal schedule
   CLOSED: [2017-02-06 Mon 10:05]
** TODO Create "personal schedule" view
** TODO Button to reload schedule
** DONE Remove "workshops" from tabs
   CLOSED: [2017-02-06 Mon 10:04]
** TODO Use days of week rather than day numbers for tabs
** TODO Footer with basic nav and SN details.
** TODO Show "starred" status on proposal view
* Local storage
** DONE Create a local storage port

   This seems like the most straightforward solution until such time as there's

* Things to think about
** How to respond when the schedule changes
** How often to refresh the view
** Some sort of alert system when selected sessions are about to start?
