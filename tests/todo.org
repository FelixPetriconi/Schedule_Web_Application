* Make "turnkey" test approach
Right now the test requires starting a dev API server externally. It would be
best if it was started as part of the test.

* Create test server and db
This should have canned data specific to the test, nothing as big or messy as
the actual database.

* Make this robust against changing days
Currently we have a hardcoded notion in the tests of which day numbers
correspond to which days. This will change with each year of the conference.
Ideally we'd "single source" this, but that may be overengineering. Give it some
thought.

* Use page objects
